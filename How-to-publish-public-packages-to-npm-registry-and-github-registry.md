# Title: **HOW TO PUBLISH PACKAGES TO NPM AND GITHUB REGISTRIES**

***

### **The Node Package Manager is an online repository where NodeJS developers can publish their packages and libraries.**

### **Besides being an online repository, npm is a command-line tool enabling developers to interact with registered packages. This tool provides features such as package installation, version management, and dependency management.**

### **The article will guide you step-by-step on publishing packages to NPM (Node Package Manager) and GitHub Package Registry. It covers the necessary steps for both registries, which may involve several steps.**

### **Prerequisites**
Below is the list of things you need to get started
- Nodejs installed
- GitHub account.
- GitHub repository for your package.

***

### **Publishing to NPM**
#### To publish packages to NPM registries, you can follow these steps:
1. You log in to your NPM account on your system. Run this command to log in.
```terminal
npm login
```


Your terminal will show a prompt to fill in your `username`, `password`, and a `two-factor authentication code` (if you enabled it on your account).

If you have followed every step above, you can now proceed to publish your package. 
Run this command to publish your package
```terminal
npm publish
```
   

To execute this command, you must provide a one-time password sent to your email address. After verification, npm will publish your package.

### **Publishing to GitHub Registries**
#### To publish packages to GitHub registries, you can follow these steps:
1. A personal access token is needed from the account you want to publish to. The personal access token should have access to the `read:packages` and `write:packages` scopes. 

2. Create a new `.npmrc` or edit an existing .npmrc in your home directory (~/.npmrc). You will now add the following line below, replacing `TOKEN` with the personal-access token you created above.  
```terminal
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=personal-access-token-goes-here
```

3. You will need to tell the package where to publish explicitly, or it will publish to the npm registry. You can do this in two ways:
   
   i. You can create a new `.npmrc` or edit an existing file in the same directory as your `package.json` file at the root of your project. Add the following line specifying the GitHub Packages URL and the account owner, and replace `OWNER` with the username of the GitHub user
   ```terminal 
   registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/OWNER‚Äù
   ```

   ii. You can edit the `package.json` file and include a publishConfig entry. You can do this by adding the below code: 
   ```terminal
    "publishConfig": { 
    "registry":"https://npm.pkg.github.com"
    },
    ```

4. You must authenticate your token by logging into NPM with the npm login command. 
```terminal
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```
Replace `username` with your GitHub username, `token` with your personal access token (PAT), and `public-email-address` with your email address that shows as a prompt in your terminal.

Finally, navigate to the root of your repository, where your package.json file is, and run the below command to publish.
```terminal
npm publish
```
