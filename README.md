Do you love writing? Or does learning to write interest you? [Submit a blog post](https://github.com/code-collabo/community-blog#formatting-and-submitting-a-new-blog-post) to be featured on [Code Collabo's blog](https://code-collabo.hashnode.dev). The blog post(s) do not have to be related to or specific to the Code Collabo community. You can write about a topic specific to open source, or even write about something that is not necessarily open source but can be useful to maintainers or users open source projects. You can also help [improve any of the already published blog posts](https://github.com/code-collabo/community-blog#improving-a-published-blog-post).

## First steps: Important things to take note of

- DO NOT copy and paste someone else's blog post from somewhere on the internet to present as your own work. Submit blog post written in your own words. If you do use someone else's words, design etc, please reference them in the blog post and include links to such works where necessary.
- Only add content that you know or are sure you can put out for free, in the blog post that you submit to this repo.
- You are also welcome to submit blog posts you have previously written on other platforms.

## Formatting and submitting a new blog post

````
**Title: Your blog post title goes here**

Subtitle: Blog post subtitle goes here (subtitle is optional)

*Blog post by [Your full name here](link to your github profile here).*

The body/content of your blog post goes here
````
- Create a new issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/code-collabo/community-blog/issues) to indicate your interest in writing a new blog post. In the issue you create, share the title and a brief description of what the blog post will contain. Once it is confirmed that you can proceed, you can then go ahead to follow the instructions below.
- Create a new branch from the main branch of this repository.
- In the new branch, create a markdown file i.e. file with .md extension. The (full) title of the blog post you are submitting should be the name of the .md file you create (make sure to use hyphens in the file name instead of spaces). 
- Use the format in the box above to add your blog content to the .md file. Here's an example of how your blog post submission should look like in a .md file after using the format in the box above - [.md file example](https://github.com/code-collabo/submit-a-blog-post/blob/main/what-is-code-collabo-and-who-is-it-for.md).
- Submit a pull request and wait for review. Here's an example of what it will look like after it is accepted and published on hashnode - [hashnode blog post example](https://code-collabo.hashnode.dev/what-is-code-collabo-and-who-is-it-for).
- Don't forget to drop links to your Twitter and LinkedIn handles in your pull request so that you can be tagged as the blog post author, when we announce the release of the blog post on our Twitter and LinkedIn handles.

## Improving a published blog post
- Create a new issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/code-collabo/community-blog/issues).

Once it is confirmed that you can proceed, you can then go ahead to follow the instructions below.
- Create a new branch from the main branch of this repository.
